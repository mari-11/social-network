# NOSQL - Social Network

## About This Project

#### the social network app allows you to connect with other users and share your thoughts, create reactions, as well as add friends.

## How it works:

#### The program is initiated currently from a back end (insomnia) which tests api routes which will create data objects according to a model structure which stores whichever api route was being used such as a GET PUT POST or DELETE route.

## Motivation:

#### I wanted to create an application that shows off how the back end of a social media app works so that people could easily see and understand what is really at work when you make posts and create an account within some simple social media applications

## Challenges:

#### I struggled to find a way to get thoughts by ID. I think I was not using the insomnia program with my API end point correctly to show it working as I believe all the code for the end point in my routes were correct.
